    <h1>The Soap Bar</h1>
    <p>To be blunt, I dont really have a specific story behind why I like this car quite like the others</p>
    <p>This is a car that I gradually got exposed to more and more throughout different racing video games and YouTube videos, and I just kinda fell for it.</p>
    <p>Every racing game I play nowadays I always pick it and customize it to my hearts content.</p>
    <p>Sometimes I'll leave it stock and just change the color of it, othertimes I'll try to re-create Keisuke Takahashi's RX-7 from Initial D.</p>
    <p>Whether it's the MX-5 from the 90s with the pop up headlights, a fully customized RX-7 race car, or a more recent, slicker looking MX-5, I just really like the car.</p>
    <p>Part of me kind of want to own one, another part of me wants more space in a car I'd drive daily...</p>
