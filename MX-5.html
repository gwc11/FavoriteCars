        <h1>The Soap Bar</h1>
        <p>To be honest, I dont really have a specific story behind why I like this car like the other ones.
        This is a car that I gradually got exposed to more and more throughout different racing games and YouTube videos, and it just kinda caught my eye.
        Every racing game I play nowadays I always buy it, customize it, and race it to my hearts content.
        Sometimes I'll leave it stock and just change the color of it, othertimes I'll re-create Keisuke Takahashi's RX-7 from Initial D.
        Whether it's the MX-5 from the 90s with the pop up headlights, a fully customized RX-7 race car, or a more recent, slicker looking MX-5, I just really like the car.
        Part of me kind of want to own one, another part of me wants more space in a car I'm going to drive daily...</p>
