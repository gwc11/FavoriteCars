            <h1>The Legend</h1>
            <p>Arguably the most iconic car across all car media, this car was made popular by both Keiichi Tsuchhiya and Initial D.
               Keiichi Tsuchiya was a professional race car driver that helped popularize the car thanks to his skillfull driving.
               Keiichi, famously nicknamed "The Drift King", used this car to showcase his unique proficiency in drifting throughout his time racing and the rest was history.
               In fact, it was thanks to his legendary abilities, that the "Initial D" series was even made.
               Heavily inspired from illegal street racing and with the help of Keiichi himself, the "Initial D" manga was created and officially published in 1995.
               The series main character, Takumi Fujiwara, main car of choice was a Toyota AE86, and he would go onto regularly dominate races with it, further adding to the populatiry of the car and turning it into the "mascot" for the series.
               Eventually an anime adaptation would be created for the manga, and thanks to its classic 90s art style, unique eurobeat soundtrack, intense races, and memorable characters, the series would become a mainstay in culture across the world.
               The series overall is one of the most iconic pieces of car media of all time, and would continue to inspire and be refrenced in other avenues of media for many years to come.
               I've been pretty obessed about this car ever since I first saw the show, and the more I've taken an intrest in car media and car culture, the more I love this car.</p>
