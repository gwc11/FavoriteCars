    <h1>The Movie Icon</h1>
    <p>The story of how I became intrested in this car is extremely random, so bear with me</p>
    <p>How I found out about this car wasn't through Fast & Furious, it  was through a completley different piece of car media.</p>
    <p>I found out about it through Rocket League, yes, the car soccer game.</p>
    <p>I had no clue what the car was, but what I did know was that it was the best looking car I'd ever seen in any game I've ever played.</p>
    <p>So for no real reason other than a love for how the car looked, I paid $10 for some virtual credits to buy the car that was a part of a Fast & Furious DLC promotion.</p>
    <p>I paid ten real world US dollars to play car soccer with this random car from a movie I didn't care about just beacuse the design of it was that amazing to me.</p>
    <p>I have no regrets.</p>
    <p>On a more serious note, I still love the design of the car till this day, and the all black Skyline that Takeshi Nakazato drives in Initial D is one of my favorite cars in the show.</p>
    <p>Maybe I'll actually watch Fast & Furious one day too, just to see this car in action...</p>
