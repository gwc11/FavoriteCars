            <h1>The Most Wanted</h1>
            <p>In November of 2005, one of the greatest racing games of all time was officialy released, "Need for Speed: Most Wanted".
            I never played this game growing up, nor did I have any interst in cars at the time, but playing 19 years later, I can say that the game deserves a good amount of its praise.
            The game does have a fair share of things I don't like about it *cough* cop milstones *cough*, it's still great fun to play.
            Now how this BMW comes into place of all this is simple, the entire game revolves around this car.
            It's on the cover of the game, it's the first car you drive in the career mode, it gets stolen from you, and now your goal is to get it back through illegal street racing.
            Ironically enough, you don't get the drive this car that much in the game, since after about 3 story-related races, it gets taken away from you.
            By time you do get the car back, you've already beaten the final boss of the game, and now all that's left is entering random races you haven't prevously done before.
            Even though you spend most of the game not racing in the car, its become iconic in its own unique way.
            I'm personally not much into car liveries, but I will admit that I love how clean this specific combo looks (it's also smooth as butter to drive in game too).</p>
